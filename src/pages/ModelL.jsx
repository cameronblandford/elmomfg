          <img src={modelCImage} className="cover-photo" />
          <p>Similar to the Model E, but with longer handles and foam rubber grips. Grade 8 socket cap screws retain clamp assembly to body. Hardened axle bolt rigidly holds male and female handles together. For longer reach greater leverage - cuts through 1.25" x .050" bands.</p>
          <p>Weight 3.4lbs., 24.5" long</p>
          <p><strong>Price USD 134.95</strong><br/>Plus shipping/handling &amps; sales tax.</p>
